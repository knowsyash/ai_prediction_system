5,Classy product,Absolutely premium product..just wow
5,Worth every penny,Battery lasted longer than my first relationship (4days). Listening to arijit singh songs on full volume since then still isn't getting over. Has more warmth than her. Unlike her there's two way communication here as touchpad is very responsive . Fingerprint unlock is nice as it only opens up to me. 5 Star for this -1 for Shivanshi
5,Highly recommended,"Just upgraded from iphone 12 to 15 and I totally loved this 15 series.Camera:- No doubt iphones camera are best of any other smartphone, primary camera is now 48mp which gives quite sharp images, 2x in portrait mode is definitely a game changer in base varient.Battery:- 3349 mAH is quite better as compared to older versions.Performance:- Apple improve performance by introducing A-16 bionic chip, no doubt performance is on top.Display:- In display we get dynamic island which gives phone mo..."

5,Classy product,A perfect n balanced phone ❣️. Was thinking of switching to ios from last two years and yeah its worth buying the black beauty 🖤.
4,Worth the money,Writing this review after extensive usage. Hope it helps interested buyers decide.1. Display:- 4/5 (Great display but limited to 60Hz in 2023-24)2. Camera:- 4/5 (Great cameras but no telephoto at this price segment but this time Apple really nailed it with the 15 series 24mp shots are very sharp and detailed)3. Performance:- 5/5 (One of the fastest SOC available right now)4. Battery:- 3/5 (Average battery life also charger not included in the box and still charges slowly with the 20w bric...
5,Wonderful,"Coming from an iPhone 11, the upgrade is not completely unnecessary. I can see few daily improvements which impacts me personally. The battery back up is a good upgrade. The cameras are obviously better. The Dynamic Island is alright but not something I cannot live without. Face ID works smoother.I am not into games, so no comments on that. For a regular person, this phone is more than enough. And for people with other Apple devices, this is just an awesome part of the ecosystem."

5,Value-for-money,"Just ok like any other premium android phone. Sound is just fantastic and face unlock feature is more convenient than fingerprint scanner. Battery backup is more than android 5000 mah battery. This is my frist iPhone, migrated from android due to chipset heating problem in Google tensor chip and Samsung exonys processsor."

5,Great product,"Arrived on launch day and after using it for a day, the iPhone 15 is AMAZING. After almost 5 years it was finally time for me to upgrade from my iPhone XR. Set up was smooth and seamless, especially using iCloud to transfer data over.The display is greatly improved, and it gets a lot brighter which is helpful outdoors. The dynamic island works smoothly even on the standard model's 60Hz screen. This phone's cameras take highly detailed photos even without a dedicated telephoto lens. In terms o..."
