5,Exceeding my expectation. Go for it.,"About the phone Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android. Why it is better than Android? You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +",Sep 2022,India,Prasanna
5,Amazing Product,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13.

1,Exchange is a scam,"I ordered an iPhone 14 as part of the current offers, which included a bonus of 2,000 on top of an exchange value of 4,800 for my iPhone 8 in excellent condition. Tempted by the deal, I decided to go ahead only to realize the exchange offer was a sham. Despite my phone being in excellent condition, the pickup agent started nitpicking, claiming there was screen discoloration along the edges. My family and I even handed him a magnifying glass to pinpoint the so-called issue, but he kept repeating the same claim like a parrot, seemingly unwilling to reconsider. Having heard of similar experiences on Flipkart and Amazon, I was prepared and had the magnifying glass ready for such assessments. When I asked him for the final exchange value, he marked the ""screen discoloration"" checkbox and showed me a revised offer: 2,600 half the originally listed 4,800. I declined the exchange, paid for the phone outright, and closed the deal. It s far better to sell your phone to platforms like Cashify or ",Dec 2024,India,sat
